Dynamic map of Bristol Airquality

Using the data and APIs on the Bristol Open Data website, it is theoretically possible to gather data regarding NO and NOx concentrations from a number of sites across the city every 15 minutes.  
I intend to collect this data and display it in a dynamic Leaflet.js map, for community use.
